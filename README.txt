## GDP Growth Forecast

This project tries to predict the different GDP for every country in the world, it uses data obtained from a SQL archive that can be found in the following link:

It consists on different models with different performances, it shows how to apply different predicting models like multilinear regressions, gradient boosting etc.
The jupyter notebooks were made to explore and build the .py programs, they may show clearly how every code works but they dont contribute to the big program.

The execution is done through cli.py which needs three parameters, "Predict" or "Train", the model you want to use "GB" or "ML" and if you want an exhaustive calculation or a fast one "R"(for results) and "T"(for time).

You can choose any of the models pre trained in the models folder named by its Rsquared and the model performing it.

Also in logs you will find all the executions done with its Rsquared if its training and if used Exhaustive methods.

For new changes or any answers contact https://github.com/urisawsing/GDP-predictor with the full repository and extra notebooks.
